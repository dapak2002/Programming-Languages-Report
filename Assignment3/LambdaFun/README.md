# Critical Appraisal
* Write the functions in pseudo code that is independent of the particular programming language used to implement the algorithm.

* Make drawings that contain pictures of the heap illustrating your algorithms.

* Document known bugs (if any).
No known bugs or errors.

* Make some interesting observations about this assignment. For example, show me the most interesting work you did on testing and debugging. Maybe inspecting the heap while debugging made you think of garbage collection, a topic that would be worth exploring.
