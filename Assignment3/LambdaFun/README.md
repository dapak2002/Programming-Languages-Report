* No known errors.

# Critical Appraisal
* Write the functions in pseudo code that is independent of the particular programming language used to implement the algorithm.
- isempty
    - if the list is an empty list return true otherwise return false

- fib
    - n in this case refers to the input
    - if n is 0 return 0 if it is 1 return 1
    - else return fib of n - 1 + fib of n - 2

- length
    - if the list is empty return 0
    - else remove the head of the list, add 1, and return the tail of the list

- even
    - if the list is empty return true
    - else

- append
    - if list is empty add element to list as head
    - else add element to the end of the list as tail
   
- reverse
    - if list is empty return the empty list
    - else 

- weave 
    - if list is empty then return empty list
    - else


* Make drawings that contain pictures of the heap illustrating your algorithms.

* Document known bugs (if any).
No known bugs or errors.

* Make some interesting observations about this assignment. For example, show me the most interesting work you did on testing and debugging. Maybe inspecting the heap while debugging made you think of garbage collection, a topic that would be worth exploring.
